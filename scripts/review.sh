# Pre-merge review gate for clawpay-sdk.
#
#   bash scripts/review.sh [BASE] [HEAD]
#
# Defaults: BASE=main, HEAD=current branch. Wraps Alibaba OpenCodeReview
# (`ocr`, /usr/bin/ocr, v1.12.9) in *delegate mode* — no LLM key required:
# it emits the review spec (which files, which rules per language) and the
# calling agent/human applies those rules to the diff by hand.
#
# Steps:
#   1. npm test — deterministic gates must be green before any review.
#   2. ocr delegate preview --from BASE --to HEAD — list the reviewable
#      changed files and how each will be reviewed.
#   3. ocr delegate rule <files> — print the resolved rule set for those
#      files (security/quality patterns the reviewer must check against).
#   4. Prompt with the checklist: the reviewer (agent or human) applies the
#      rules to the diff and fixes blockers/majors before merging.
#
# If the ECC v2.2.1 harness is installed, run `npm run review:ecc` as well
# (it adds the secret-pattern scan + the Claude Code /code-review step);
# if `claude` is not present that half is manual — see docs/CODE_REVIEW.md.
