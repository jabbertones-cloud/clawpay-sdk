# Pre-push review gate for clawpay-sdk (GREENFIELD glue script —
# nothing suitable existed in Scott's repos or upstream to reuse).
#
#   npm run review:ecc
#
# Does three things, in order:
#   1. Deterministic gates: npm test + secret-pattern scan of staged changes.
#      Fails the push on any finding.
#   2. Verifies the pinned ECC release (see .ecc-version, currently 2.2.1)
#      resolves from npm — the review itself runs inside Claude Code.
#   3. If the `claude` CLI is present, offers to launch ECC's /code-review
#      non-interactively; otherwise prints the manual steps.
#
# The ECC half of code review is intentionally local (ECC is a Claude Code
# harness, not a CI tool). See docs/CODE_REVIEW.md.
